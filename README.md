## Repo Introduction

> English | [中文](README_zh.md)

KubeSphere provides a Jenkins-based DevOps system [with various features](https://kubesphere.io/docs/devops-user-guide/understand-and-manage-devops-projects/overview/#features). This repository is used for a SpringBoot demo for DevOps on KubeSphere. For example, you can find a file of `Jenkinsfile-online` in the root directory, and you can use it to create a pipeline through the **Jenkinsfile in SCM** method.

For more information about how to use the KubeSphere DevOps system, you can refer to the following list of KubeSphere official documents.
